ADS-B stands for Automatic Dependent Surveillance â€“ Broadcast:

Automatic because it periodically transmits information with no pilot or operator involvement required.
Dependent because the position and velocity vectors are derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS) or other suitable Navigation Systems (i.e., FMS).
Surveillance because it provides a method of determining 3 dimensional position and identification of aircraft, vehicles, or other assets.
Broadcast because it transmits the information available to anyone with the appropriate receiving equipment.
ADS-B replaces radar technology with satellites, bringing major advantages. Radar relies on radio signals and antennas to determine an aircraft's location. ADS-B uses satellite signals to track aircraft movements.

ADS-B Out
ADS-B Out works by broadcasting information about an aircraft's GPS location, altitude, ground speed and other data to ground stations and other aircraft, once per second. Air traffic controllers and aircraft equipped with ADS-B In can immediately receive this information. This offers more precise tracking of aircraft compared to radar technology, which sweeps for position information every 5 to 12 seconds.

Radio waves are limited to line of site meaning radar signals cannot travel long distances or penetrate mountains and other solid objects. ADS-B ground stations are smaller and more adaptable than radar towers and can be placed in locations not possible with radar. With ground stations in place throughout the country, even in hard to reach areas, ADS-B provides better visibility regardless of the terrain or other obstacles.

Aircraft operating in most controlled U.S. airspace must be equipped with ADS-B Out.
